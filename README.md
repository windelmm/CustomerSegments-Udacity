# Identify Customers Segments

In this project, I used unsupervised learning techniques to identify segments of the population that form the core customer base for a mail-order sales company in Germany. These segments could then be used to direct marketing campaigns towards audiences that will have the highest expected rate of returns.

# Motivation

This project is part of the Data Science Nanodegree by Udacity and specifically completed using Unsupervised Learning.

# Build Status

This project is considered complete.

# Use

This application is build using Jupyter Notebook, Python and the following libraries.
* Pandas
* Numpy
* Scikit-Learn
* Matplotlib

The data is provided by Udacity and Bertelsmann Arvato Analytics

# Results

The project was completed with the following steps.

* Preprocessing
* Feature Transformation
* Clustering

The mail order company seems to attract people who are well of financialy compared to the general population, people in larger communities, mostly younger generations. The correlations make sense too, younger generations in the west are highly educated and hold higher paying jobs, mostly found in cities. Which can be translated to middle to upper middle class people in some ways, they seem to be over represented in the companies customers data.
